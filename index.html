                                            identifies a trend wherein drawings
                                            transition from basic and impromptu
                                            expressions to intricate, lifelike

                                painting at the tender age of five. His journey
                                continued with unwavering passion, inspired by a

                                painting. This work depicts the conflict's harsh
                                realities, showcasing a soldier attacking
                                civilians and a defiant hand reaching out,
                                symbolizing Ukraine's unwavering spirit.

                                Twelve-year-old Karen, a hyperrealism artist
                                from Nigeria, is a testament to the
                                transformative power of talent and artistic
                                expression. Drawing inspiration from his
                                surroundings and his family's resilience in the
                                face of adversity, Karen's latest work,
                                "Vision," encapsulates his artistic journey.
                                Completed in just two hours, this masterpiece
                                speaks volumes about his exceptional talent.
                                Karen's art has not only garnered him
                                recognition but has also brought fortune to his
                                family. His remarkable skills have opened doors
                                to new opportunities, allowing them to move to a
                                better apartment and enroll him in a prestigious
                                school. The Art Academy, where Karen's artistic
                                journey began, has now seen a remarkable
                                transformation. Inspired by Karen's success, the
                                Academy now boasts a well-equipped studio
                                designed to nurture young artistic talent. Karen
                                still frequents the Academy every weekend,
                                dedicating his time to honing his skills and
                                learning new techniques through textbooks. For
                                Karen, art has always been a sanctuary, a means
                                of escape from the hardships he and his family
                                have faced. As his local fame continues to grow,
                                Karen's aspirations remain firmly set on
                                achieving global recognition. He dreams of
                                emulating artists like Leonardo da Vinci and of
                                leaving his mark on the world, much like the
                                iconic Mona Lisa. Karen's story is a powerful
                                testament to the potential within each of us. It
                                serves as a beacon of hope, reminding us that
                                even in the face of adversity, creativity and
                                talent can pave the way to a brighter future. As
                                Karen continues to evolve as an artist, the
                                world eagerly awaits the next masterpiece to
                                emerge from his brushstroke, a testament to his
                                vision and unwavering spirit.

                            <p>
                                I do not know how to analyze this drawing, but
                                when I asked the child, she said that it is a
                                girl wearing a dress. I do not know where the
                                girl is, nor do I know exactly where the dress
                                is, but since the girl is two years old and not
                                talented, this drawing is considered realistic
                                for her age. According to James Sully's
                                classification, this is the stage of
                                "non-purposeful, blurry drawings', as it is
                                considered the first stage of the development of
                                children's drawings from the age of 2 to 6
                                years, with the abundance of random lines
                                extending horizontally. The girl does not suffer
                                from any health or psychological problems that
                                might affect her choice of color, so we notice
                                her use of lively colors as they are her
                                favorite colors, and she may enjoy the effect of
                                the colors when moving it on a white surface
                                “paper”.

                            <h3>10-year-old girl, The Sea</h3>
                            <p>
                                I asked this girl to draw a drawing using colors
                                with poor-quality and then repeat the same
                                drawing but with high-quality colors. The
                                picture above was with the high-quality colors.
                                I noticed that the girl had more fun when using
                                them and was more focused while drawing. As for
                                the picture below, she was using the
                                poor-quality colors, The girl was distracted and
                                could not complete the drawing on the same day.
                                My friend kept asking her to complete the
                                drawing for two days until she finally sat down
                                and completed the drawing, haha. So, the quality
                                of the tools really affects the child’s mood and
                                creativity as well. The effect of artistic tools

                                two paintings, one with high-quality tools and
                                the other with poor-quality tools)

                            <h3>6-year-old boy: Zombie</h3>
                            <p>
                                This kid made several omissions in his drawing;
                                for example, he just sketched the legs and left
                                out the hands which might indicate incompetence
                                and feeling of insecurity, and considered the
                                hair to be an unnecessary detail. I believe that
                                since it's a drawing of a boy, he doesn't value
                                hair as much as girls do. In addition, he did
                                not sketch the face's outline and removed the
                                ears and nose. All he did was scatter the mouth
                                and eyes above the body. It is also observed
                                that the legs have three instead of five toes. I
                                believe that his carelessness is to blame rather
                                than his ignorance of the fact that each leg has
                                five toes. Even though all the colors were
                                available, the child only used one in the
                                drawing. I mistakenly believed that to be his
                                favorite color, but when I asked him, he said
                                that since he paints "a zombie," grey should be
                                the color. Also According to H.read's
                                classification, this is the stage of
                                "Descriptive symbolism".

                            <p>
                                In this drawing, I asked the child to draw the
                                family, so he drew his father, two brothers, and
                                his older and younger sister, ignoring the
                                mother for no apparent reason, but what is worth
                                emphasizing is that he drew himself larger than
                                everyone, which may indicate his excessive
                                activity, and his color was different from them,
                                despite Although everyone was drawn in the basic
                                "Stickman" style, he added pupils to his eyes
                                and was also as happy as the rest of them. The
                                bright/vibrant color on his head indicates
                                self-importance or perhaps his feeling of lack
                                of confidence or importance, so he drew what he
                                wished to achieve, so the color made him
                                distinctive among the family and more important.

                                This child drew his two older brothers, but he
                                used one color. When I asked him, he said that
                                he had drawn his two brothers when they came out
                                of the bathroom and they were wrapping the bath
                                towel around themselves and it was red, so he
                                only used red, therefore I don't think it's

                                choice of color. We may notice that he drew them
                                without their hands, it says that's because he
                                felt their incompetence and lack of strength but
                                I do not think that is very true because I know
                                the child personally, It may just be negligence
                                from him, no more. He also ignored some details,
                                such as the mouth, nose, and ears of the other
                                brother, but that is in line with him being a
                                boy, as they tend to ignore details.

                            <p>
                                The child drew the flag of Palestine with a big
                                heart to emphasize his love for the country and
                                the flag, and he drew the flag of Israel with a
                                wrong sign to indicate his hatred for them. We
                                may notice that there are some numbers above
                                each flag. When the child was asked, he said,
                                “Palestine is a million times more beautiful
                                than Israel” so we see the number 100,000 in
                                Arabic and English above the flag of Palestine,
                                and the number 50 in Arabic above the flag of
                                Israel.

                        <p>
                            I asked my parents to draw me, and the difference
                            was very big and in line with their nature as a
                            female and a male, as my father tended to ignore
                            some details. He only drew half of my body, my eyes
                            had no pupils, and the mouth was only the outline of
                            the mouth, while my mother added more details. She
                            added eyelashes, or “eyeliner,” and pupils, and drew
                            the mouth better with curves and so on. She also
                            drew my entire body with the fingers on my hand, but
                            she did not focus on the number of fingers. I don’t
                            know why. This is in line with her nature as a
                            female as she focuses on details more. My mother's
                            drawing is characterized by the axial distribution
                            method, where I was the center of the painting and
                            the other things around me, and so is my father's
                            drawing. My mother drew the line of the earth and
                            time, where it was morning, while my father did not
                            clarify the time, he oly drew me and a table with a
                            cup on it, as he said that it is my favorite cup in
                            which I always drink coffee in, and he drew a palm
                            tree with two hearts. The two hearts may indicate
                            his love for me, who knows? My mother also drew
                            hearts, butterflies, and flowers around me, and
                            drawing hearts may also indicate the same reason.
                            All of this is very consistent with children’s
                            drawing, as male children tend to ignore many
                            details while girls focus on details more, as well
                            as the method of distributing elements in the
                            painting, the land line, and time, all of which are
                            similar to the characteristics that we find in
                            children’s drawings. I think there is a similarity
                            not because they are similar, but because children
                            do not know while adults do not care.

                        <p>
                            I tried to simulate children's drawings in the
                            descriptive symbolic stage, 5-6 years old, according
                            to Herbert Read's classification of the development
                            of children's drawings. I think that if I were at
                            that age and not talented, I would have drawn like
                            this, because I always thought that I was better
                            than the rest for some reason. I expect that it was
                            because I was the youngest in the family and that I
                            received great attention from them, and also because
                            I was talented that I saw myself as better than the
                            rest of the children in my age, so I drew a big head
                            and big eyes with colored eyelashes because I think
                            I am beautiful and also because this is in line with
                            my age as a six-year-old female child, where I focus
                            on details more than male children. I also added
                            hearts as details in my clothes and used my favorite
                            colors in the clothes. I also combined drawing and
                            writing, as I wrote "Mama, Baba" because they are
                            important to me and I love them very much, and I
                            also drew a heart.
